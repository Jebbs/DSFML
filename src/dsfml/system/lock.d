/**
 * $(U Lock) is a RAII wrapper for DSFML's Mutex.
 *
 * By unlocking it in its destructor, it ensures that the mutex will always be
 * released when the current scope (most likely a function) ends. This is even
 * more important when an exception or an early return statement can interrupt
 * the execution flow of the function.
 *
 * For maximum robustness, $(U Lock) should always be used to lock/unlock a
 * mutex.
 *
 * Note that this structure is provided for convenience when porting projects
 * from SFML to DSFML. The same effect can be achieved with scope guards and
 * Mutex.
 *
 * Example:
 * ---
 * auto mutex = Mutex();
 *
 * void function()
 * {
 *     auto lock = Lock(mutex); // mutex is now locked
 *
 *	   // mutex is unlocked if this function throws
 *     functionThatMayThrowAnException();
 *
 *     if (someCondition)
 *         return; // mutex is unlocked
 *
 * } // mutex is unlocked
 * ---
 *
 * $(PARA Because the mutex is not explicitly unlocked in the code, it may
 * remain locked longer than needed. If the region of the code that needs to be
 * protected by the mutex is not the entire function, a good practice is to
 * create a smaller, inner scope so that the lock is limited to this part of the
 * code.)
 *
 * Example:
 * ---
 * auto mutex = Mutex();
 *
 * void function()
 * {
 *     {
 *       auto lock = Lock(mutex);
 *       codeThatRequiresProtection();
 *
 *     } // mutex is unlocked here
 *
 *     codeThatDoesntCareAboutTheMutex();
 * }
 * ---
 *
 * $(PARA Having a mutex locked longer than required is a bad practice which can
 * lead to bad performances. Don't forget that when a mutex is locked, other
 * threads may be waiting doing nothing until it is released.)
