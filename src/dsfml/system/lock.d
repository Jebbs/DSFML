/**
*Automatic wrapper for locking and unlocking mutexes.
*
*Lock is a RAII wrapper for DSFML's Mutex.
*
*By unlocking it in its destructor, it ensures that the mutex will always be released when the current scope (most likely a function) ends.
*This is even more important when an exception or an early return statement can interrupt the execution flow of the function.
*
*For maximum robustness, Lock should always be used to lock/unlock a mutex.
