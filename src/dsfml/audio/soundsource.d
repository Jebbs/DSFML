 + Base class defining a sound's properties.
 + 
 + SoundSource is not meant to be used directly, it only serves as a common base for all audio objects that can live in the audio environment.
 + 
 + It defines several properties for the sound: pitch, volume, position, attenuation, etc. All of them can be changed at any time with no impact on performances.

	 * The pitch of the sound.
	 * 
	 * The pitch represents the perceived fundamental frequency of a sound; thus you can make a sound more acute or grave by changing its pitch. A side effect of changing the pitch is to modify the playing speed of the sound as well. The default value for the pitch is 1.

	 * The minimum distance of the sound.

Further than the minimum distance, it will start to fade out according to its attenuation factor. A value of 0 ("inside the head of the listener") is an invalid value and is forbidden.

	 * The attenuation factor of the sound.

	 * The attenuation is a multiplicative factor which makes the sound more or less loud according to its distance from the listener. An attenuation of 0 will produce a non-attenuated sound, i.e. its volume will always be the same whether it is heard from near or from far. 
	 * 
	 * On the other hand, an attenuation value such as 100 will make the sound fade out very quickly as it gets further from the listener. The default value of the attenuation is 1.
