/++
 + Specialized SoundRecorder which stores the captured audio data into a sound buffer.
 + 
 + SoundBufferRecorder allows to access a recorded sound through a SoundBuffer, so that it can be played, saved to a file, etc.
 + 
 + It has the same simple interface as its base class (start(), stop()) and adds a function to retrieve the recorded sound buffer (getBuffer()).
 + 
 + As usual, don't forget to call the isAvailable() function before using this class (see SoundRecorder for more details about this).
 + 
 + See_Also: http://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.0/classsf_1_1SoundBufferRecorder.php#details
