///A module containing the ContextSettings struct.
module dsfml.window.contextsettings;

/**
 *Structure defining the settings of the OpenGL context attached to a window.
 *
 *ContextSettings allows to define several advanced settings of the OpenGL context attached to a window.
 *
 *All these settings have no impact on the regular SFML rendering (graphics module) â€“ except the 
 *anti-aliasing level, so you may need to use this structure only if you're using SFML as a windowing system for custom OpenGL rendering.
 *
 *The depthBits and stencilBits members define the number of bits per pixel requested for the (respectively) depth and stencil buffers.
 *
 *antialiasingLevel represents the requested number of multisampling levels for anti-aliasing.
 *
 *majorVersion and minorVersion define the version of the OpenGL context that you want. Only versions
 *greater or equal to 3.0 are relevant; versions lesser than 3.0 are all handled the same way (i.e. you 
 *(can use any version < 3.0 if you don't want an OpenGL 3 context).
 *
 *Please note that these values are only a hint. No failure will be reported if one or more of these 
 *values are not supported by the system; instead, SFML will try to find the closest valid match. 
 *You can then retrieve the settings that the window actually used to create its context, with Window.getSettings().
