/**
 *Give access to the real-time state of the joysticks.
 *
 *Joystick provides an interface to the state of the joysticks.
 *
 *It only contains static functions, so it's not meant to be instanciated. Instead, each joystick is identified
  *by an index that is passed to the functions of this class.
 *
 *This class allows users to query the state of joysticks at any time and directly, without having to deal with
 *a window and its events. Compared to the JoystickMoved, JoystickButtonPressed and JoystickButtonReleased events,
 *Joystick can retrieve the state of axes and buttons of joysticks at any time (you don't need to store and update
 *a boolean on your side in order to know if a button is pressed or released), and you always get the real state of
 *joysticks, even if they are moved, pressed or released when your window is out of focus and no event is triggered.
