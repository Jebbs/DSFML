/**
 *Socket that listens to new TCP connections.
 *
 *A listener socket is a special type of socket that listens to a given port and waits for connections on that port.
 *
 *This is all it can do.
 *
 *When a new connection is received, you must call accept and the listener returns a new instance of sf::TcpSocket that is properly initialized and can be used to communicate with the new client.
 *
 *Listener sockets are specific to the TCP protocol, UDP sockets are connectionless and can therefore communicate directly. As a consequence, a listener socket will always return the new connections as sf::TcpSocket instances.
 *
 *A listener is automatically closed on destruction, like all other types of socket. However if you want to stop listening before the socket is destroyed, you can call its close() function.
