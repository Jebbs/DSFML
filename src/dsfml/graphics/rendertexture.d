 + Target for off-screen 2D rendering into a texture.
 +
 + RenderTexture is the little brother of RenderWindow.
 +
 + It implements the same 2D drawing and OpenGL-related functions (see their base class RenderTarget for more details), the difference is that the result is stored in an off-screen texture rather than being show in a window.
 +
 + Rendering to a texture can be useful in a variety of situations:
 + - precomputing a complex static texture (like a level's background from multiple tiles)
 + - applying post-effects to the whole scene with shaders
 + - creating a sprite from a 3D object rendered with OpenGL
 + - etc.
