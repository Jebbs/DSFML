 + Specialized shape representing a circle.
 + 
 + This class inherits all the functions of Transformable (position, rotation, scale, bounds, ...) as well as the functions of Shape (outline, color, texture, ...).
 + 
 + Since the graphics card can't draw perfect circles, we have to fake them with multiple triangles connected to each other. The "points count" property of CircleShape defines how many of these triangles to use, and therefore defines the quality of the circle.
