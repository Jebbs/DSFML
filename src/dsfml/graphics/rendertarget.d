 + Base class for all render targets (window, texture, ...)
 + 
 + RenderTarget defines the common behaviour of all the 2D render targets usable in the graphics module.
 + 
 + It makes it possible to draw 2D entities like sprites, shapes, text without using any OpenGL command directly.
 + 
 + A RenderTarget is also able to use views which are a kind of 2D cameras. With views you can globally scroll, rotate or zoom everything that is drawn, without having to transform every single entity.
 + 
 + On top of that, render targets are still able to render direct OpenGL stuff. It is even possible to mix together OpenGL calls and regular SFML drawing commands. When doing so, make sure that OpenGL states are not messed up by calling the pushGLStates/popGLStates functions.
