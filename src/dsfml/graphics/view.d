 + 2D camera that defines what region is shown on screen
 + 
 + View defines a camera in the 2D scene.
 + 
 + This is a very powerful concept: you can scroll, rotate or zoom the entire scene without altering the way that your drawable objects are drawn.
 + 
 + A view is composed of a source rectangle, which defines what part of the 2D scene is shown, and a target viewport, which defines where the contents of the source rectangle will be displayed on the render target (window or texture).
 + 
 + The viewport allows to map the scene to a custom part of the render target, and can be used for split-screen or for displaying a minimap, for example. If the source rectangle has not the same size as the viewport, its contents will be stretched to fit in.
 + 
 + To apply a view, you have to assign it to the render target. Then, every objects drawn in this render target will be affected by the view until you use another view.
