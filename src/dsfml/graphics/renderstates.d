 + Define the states used for drawing to a RenderTarget.
 +
 + There are four global states that can be applied to the drawn objects:
 + - the blend mode: how pixels of the object are blended with the background
 + - the transform: how the object is positioned/rotated/scaled
 + - the texture: what image is mapped to the object
 + - the shader: what custom effect is applied to the object
 +
 + High-level objects such as sprites or text force some of these states when they are drawn. For example, a sprite will set its own texture, so that you don't have to care about it when drawing the sprite.
 +
 + The transform is a special case: sprites, texts and shapes (and it's a good idea to do it with your own drawable classes too) combine their transform with the one that is passed in the RenderStates structure. So that you can use a "global" transform on top of each object's transform.
 +
 + Most objects, especially high-level drawables, can be drawn directly without defining render states explicitely â€“ the default set of states is ok in most cases.
 +
 + If you want to use a single specific render state, for example a shader, you can pass it directly to the Draw function: RenderStates has an implicit one-argument constructor for each state.
 +
 + When you're inside the Draw function of a drawable object (inherited from sf::Drawable), you can either pass the render states unmodified, or change some of them. For example, a transformable object will combine the current transform with its own transform. A sprite will set its texture. Etc.
