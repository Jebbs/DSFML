/++
 + Decomposed transform defined by a position, a rotation, and a scale.
 + 
 + This template is provided for convenience, on top of Transformable (and Transform).
 + 
 + Transform, as a low-level class, offers a great level of flexibility but it is not always convenient to manage. Indeed, one can easily combine any kind of operation, such as a translation followed by a rotation followed by a scaling, but once the result transform is built, there's no way to go backward and, let's say, change only the rotation without modifying the translation and scaling.
 + 
 + The entire transform must be recomputed, which means that you need to retrieve the initial translation and scale factors as well, and combine them the same way you did before updating the rotation. This is a tedious operation, and it requires to store all the individual components of the final transform.
 + 
 + That's exactly what Transformable was written for: it hides these variables and the composed transform behind an easy to use interface. You can set or get any of the individual components without worrying about the others. It also provides the composed transform (as a Transform), and keeps it up-to-date.
