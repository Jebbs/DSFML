Opening a new Issue
===

When opening a new issue, please remember that while I want this library to feel very D-like, I also want to keep it as true to SFML as possible. If you have a suggestion, I am always willing to discuss it, but I want it to make sense for the library. Just because it isn't a part of SFML doesn't mean it wouldn't be something that could make the library better either. If we can do something better in D than we could in C++, then we should (See https://github.com/Jebbs/DSFML/pull/109).

Opening a Pull Request
===

When opening a pull request, don't forget to check the guidelines for opening a new issue if your pull has a new feature. If you are usure that it fits with the library, you can always open an issue first and then a pull request later.

Please take a quick look at my notes for source file layouts before you submit the pull request. (https://gist.github.com/Jebbs/8904535)
