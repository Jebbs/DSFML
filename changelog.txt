=======

IpAddress
---------
Updated IpAddress to match the current SFML IpAddress structure, and changed all
IpAddress usage to use the structure directly instead of relying on internal
helper functions.

Updated the IpAddress from bytes and from uint constructors to run at compile
time.

Added the IpAddress.Any constant, which represents any Ip Address.

TcpListener
----------
The listen function can now accept a specific IpAddress to listen to, and
defaults to IpAddress.Any.

UdpSocket
----------
The bind function can now accept a specific IpAddress to be bound to, and
defaults to IpAddress.Any.
