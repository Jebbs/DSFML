DSFML 2.4
=========

General
=======

Added Supported Compilers:
- DMD 2.074.1, 2.075.0
- LDC 1.2.0, 1.3.0

Dropped Supported Compilers:
- DMD 2.067.1 (Windows version does not include mscoff32 libs)
- LDC 1.0.0 (Not correctly configured on Travic CI for OSX)
- LDC 0.17.x (New versions of this compiler are not built for Windows)
- LDC 0.16.1 (Droped support for DMD version 2.067)

System
======

Vector2
-------
Bool types are now allowed(to be compatible with the GLSL moddule)


Vector3
-------
Bool types are now allowed(to be compatible with the GLSL moddule)



Network
=======

IpAddress
---------
Updated IpAddress to match the current SFML IpAddress structure, and changed all
IpAddress usage to use the structure directly instead of relying on internal
helper functions.

Updated the IpAddress from bytes and from uint constructors to run at compile
time.

Added the IpAddress.Any constant, which represents any Ip Address.


TcpListener
----------
The listen function can now accept a specific IpAddress to listen to, and
defaults to IpAddress.Any.


TcpSocket
--------
Fixed an internal issue with receiving raw data.


UdpSocket
----------
The bind function can now accept a specific IpAddress to be bound to, and
defaults to IpAddress.Any.

Fixed an internal issue with receiving raw data.


Window
======

Event
-----
MouseWheelEvent was marked as deprecated (Use MouseWheelScrollEvent instead).


Graphics
========

GLSL
----
Added glsl.d, which has all the things needed for GLSL functions.


PrimitiveType
------------
Added LineStrip, TriangleStrip, and TriangleFan members.

LinesStrip, TrianglesStrip, and TrianglesFan were marked as deprecated (instead,
use LineStrip, TriangleStrip, and TriangleFan respectively).


RenderWindow
------------
Added RenderWindow.capture, and then marked it as deprecated. Although this was
immediately marked as deprecated, it should still be present in the current API.
Use a Texture, its update function, and copy its contents into an Image instead.


Shader
------
Added setUniform and setUniformArray functions.

Changed opIndexAssign functions to use the setUniform and setUniformArray
functions instead of the setParameter functions where applicable.

Added opIndexAssign for new setUniform and setUniformArray where needed.

Marked all setParameter functions as deprecated. Use their setUniform variants
instead.

Texture
-------
Marked updateFromImage, updateFromPixels, updateFromWindow, and updateFromWindow
as deprecated. These have been replaced by their respective update overloads,
which are now also work with const objects if they didn't already.

Added update functions for pixels, an Image, and Window/RenderWindow without the
need to define an x and y.

Transform
--------
getMatrix is now a const function.
