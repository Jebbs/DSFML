DSFML 2.4
=========

General
=======

Build System
------------
Changed build system to produce only one set of static libraries instead of two.

Updated interface file generation to not produce package.di files.

Performed some major refactoring to clean up and simplify build script.


Compiler Support
----------------
Added Supported Compilers:
- DMD 2.074.1, 2.075.0
- LDC 1.2.0, 1.3.0

Dropped Supported Compilers:
- DMD 2.067.1 (Windows version does not include mscoff32 libs)
- LDC 1.0.0 (Not correctly configured on Travic CI for OSX)
- LDC 0.17.x (New versions of this compiler are not built for Windows)
- LDC 0.16.1 (Droped support for DMD version 2.067)


Documentation
-------------
Added documentation to functions that had none.

Moved detailed class description to the module, which causes it to be displayed
towards the top of the generated documentation.

Added code examples.

Documentation for property functions is no longer displayed twice when there
exists a getter and setter.

Added links to related modules.

Removed the authors section in the documentation as it doesn't add anything of
substance.

Added ddoc files for locally generated documentation and documentation meant for
the dsfml.org website.


Other
-----
Moved everything relating to DSFMLC into the src/DSFMLC directory, cleaning up
the top level directory a little.


System
======

Err
---
Added a custom stream buffer on the C++ side to more cleanly get SFML's error
output sent to DSFML's err File. This also automates the process, eliminating
the need to check for errors each time in DSFML.

Time
----
Removed the usage of core.time's Duration struct in favor of the original Time
struct. This was done in hopes of removing any cofusion users might have had
because Time was missing, which wasn't well documented or handled.

Time now supports converting to/from core.time's Duration struct via the
duration and asDuration methods for those that wish to work directly with this
struct.


Vector2
-------
Bool types are now allowed(to be compatible with the GLSL moddule).


Vector3
-------
Bool types are now allowed(to be compatible with the GLSL moddule).


Network
=======

IpAddress
---------
Updated IpAddress to match the current SFML IpAddress structure, and changed all
IpAddress usage to use the structure directly instead of relying on internal
helper functions.

Updated the IpAddress from bytes and from uint constructors to run at compile
time.

Added the IpAddress.Any constant, which represents any Ip Address.

Socket
------
Changed socket to be an interface as opposed to an abstract class. This allows
setBlocking and isBlocking to be declared here as they are common between all
sockets that inherit from the Socket interface.


TcpListener
----------
The listen function can now accept a specific IpAddress to listen to, and
defaults to IpAddress.Any.


TcpSocket
--------
Fixed an internal issue with receiving raw data.


UdpSocket
----------
The bind function can now accept a specific IpAddress to be bound to, and
defaults to IpAddress.Any.

Fixed an internal issue with receiving raw data.


Window
======

Event
-----
MouseWheelEvent was marked as deprecated (Use MouseWheelScrollEvent instead).

Window
------
Deprecated using string's and wstring's to set the title.


Graphics
========

Color
-----
Added the color * color and color*= color operators, which SFML calls
modulation.


GLSL
----
Added glsl.d, which has all the types related to working with GLSL functions.


PrimitiveType
------------
Added LineStrip, TriangleStrip, and TriangleFan members.

LinesStrip, TrianglesStrip, and TrianglesFan were marked as deprecated (instead,
use LineStrip, TriangleStrip, and TriangleFan respectively).


Text
----
Updated Text class to be current as of SFML 2.4.

Added properties to replace getters/setters, which were then deprecated.

Deprecated using string's and wstring's to set the contents of the Text.


RenderWindow
------------
Added RenderWindow.capture, and then marked it as deprecated. Although this was
immediately marked as deprecated, it should still be present in the current API.
Use a Texture, its update function, and copy its contents into an Image instead.

Deprecated using string's and wstring's to set the title.


Shader
------
Added support for geometry shaders.

Added setUniform and setUniformArray functions.

Changed opIndexAssign functions to use the setUniform and setUniformArray
functions instead of the setParameter functions where applicable.

Added opIndexAssign for new setUniform and setUniformArray where needed.

Marked all setParameter functions as deprecated. Use their setUniform variants
instead.


Texture
-------
Marked updateFromImage, updateFromPixels, updateFromWindow, and updateFromWindow
as deprecated. These have been replaced by their respective update overloads,
which are now also work with const objects if they didn't already.

Added update functions for pixels, an Image, and Window/RenderWindow without the
need to define an x and y.


Transform
--------
getMatrix is now a const function.
