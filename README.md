DSFML
=====

This is the "Experimental" branch of the DSFML project. Experimental might not be the correct term, as it is what will eventually become the new Master branch of the project, and as such won't be as complete as the Master branch until this one overtakes the other. This branch will feature its own custom version of a C shared library(akin to CSFML) for better interfacing between languages as well as being a little more complete for easier code porting. 


Compiling DSFML(C)
===

To compile the C libraries DSFML uses, you will need Cmake and a compatible static version of the SFML modules. Building DSFML will be the exact same as building CSFML.


Compiling a project using DSFML
===

You can use DSFML in one of two ways, both of which are simple. You can either compile the source code into a library and link against it in your final project, or simply include the source code along with your own when compiling. 



If problems are encountered!
===

As this branch includes both C/C++ code AND D code, there are bound to be more issues that could arise. Feel free to email me of simply put an issue in the tracker!
